Developed the use of an additive for PET to achieve structural color while avoiding the use<span id="dots_PG2">...  </span><span id="more_PG2"> of TiO<sub>2</sub>-based dyes in order to improve the sustainability outlook of the bottle. Saw the project through materials selection, coordination with suppliers, sample creation, testing, troubleshooting crystallinity issues, developing process changes as a solution to these issues, and implementing changes to create improved samples. Delivered in-depth analysis of the parameters needed to successfully run the additive on production-scale machinery, developed new test procedures for the polymers lab, and designed and programmed a tool to automate the photography, naming, categorization, and uploading to SharePoint Online of experimental retains using Python, C++, and the SharePoint Online REST API.   </span><a onclick="expand_collapse('dots_PG2','more_PG2','btn_PG2')" id="btn_PG2">Read More</a></p>

									<h3>Education</h3>
									<p>I completed my Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering in May of 2022, graduating from The Ohio State University with Honors in Engineering and a perfect 4.0 GPA. I also completed my honors research thesis, entitled "Rational Design of Reverse Osmosis Membrane Materials via Pore Geometry Evaluation in a Molecular Dynamics Model", earning an additional Honors Research Distinction in Chemical Engineering on my diploma.</p>
									<p>Beginning in August 2022, I began a doctoral program at Cornell University in Chemical Engineering, jointly advised by Professor Jefferson Tester and Professor Jeffrey Varner.</p>
